# Test Instructions
Follow the installation instructions, then using a tool like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) you can work with the API and look at change and manipulate the database.  

# Thoughts
This was a very good reinforcement training to help properly work with API's. It was initially difficult but once I got in a rhythm it became easier and easier.
